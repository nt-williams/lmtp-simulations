### Instructions

This repository contains the code used for the simulation study in the paper "Non-parametric casual effects based on longitudinal modified treatment policies." Simulations are designed to be run on a high performance computing cluster using Slurm. The main file structure is as follows:

-   R: Contains R function definition scripts.

-   scripts: Contains R scripts that run the simulations and summarize simulation results.

-   results: Contains simulation results.

**This simulation uses a special version of the *lmtp*** **package that allows for different *SuperLearner* calls at every time point.**
