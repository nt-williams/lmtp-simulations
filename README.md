### Instructions

This repository contains the code used for the simulation study in the paper "Non-parametric casual effects based on longitudinal modified treatment policies." Simulations are designed to be run on a high performance computing cluster using Slurm. The file structure is:

-   R: Contains R function definition scripts.

-   scripts: Contains R scripts that run the simulations and summarize simulation results.
